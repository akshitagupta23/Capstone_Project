# Capstone_Project
## End to End ML Process

The aim of this project is to show how ML model building through the eye of enterprise level i.e how an business problem is delivered in production. 
Implementation of E2E ML process is done through following steps.

> Step 1 Research Phase

> Step 2 Building of Web APP

> Step 3 Containerisation of Project

> Step 4 Google Cloud Platform Deployment (serverless)

> Step 5 CI/CD: Continous Integration & Continous Deployement


### Business Problem
Customer Churn is one of the nightmares any organisation wants to see. It incurs expenditures on any organization and loss of brand value. 
To tackle this we need to understand the customer base that are likely to be churned. The Customer churn app that we have proposed here predicts the likelihoodof customer getting churned or not.

### DataSet
 We have used open source dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It has 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).
 
 Brief description of dastaset is as follows ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn))
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
